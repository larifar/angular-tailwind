# Angular+TailwindCss Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.10. This project was my first experience with TailwindCSS. The goal was to take a simple reference from Dribbble and replicate it using Angular and TailwindCSS.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Dribbble Reference
